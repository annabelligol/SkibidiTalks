  <textarea placeholder='🚽🔥 Skibidi Sigma Chronicles II: THE MEDIATOR – LAKSHYA’S REDEMPTION ARC 🔥🚽
(Subtitle: “Reuniting the Homies”)

🎬 Intro shot: Lakshya enters frame walking in slow motion, surrounded by Skibidi Toilets doing synchronized TikTok dances. Thunder claps. Beat drops.
🎵 Soundtrack: "NPC Trap Beat x Sigma Ohio Remix"

🎤 Narrator (with reverb):
"In a world full of betrayal… where memes became weapons… one man refused to let friendship die…"

👤 Lakshya.
💬 Known in the streets as “THE EMOTIONAL DAMAGE HEALER.”
💪 Built like a sigma.
🧠 Wise like Master Oogway.
😤 Dripped out in Crocs and confidence.

🎞️ Flashback montage of Agastya doing 1000 pushups in rage while Arya listens to sad Spotify playlists in the rain.
💔 “BROKEN FRIENDSHIP = GLOBAL L” flashes on screen.

🥶 But Lakshya had seen enough.
🗣️ “NAH, NOT ON MY WATCH.”

🧠 He forms the PLAN OF REUNIFICATION (cut to him drawing a 5D chess diagram with Agastya and Arya s Bitmojis).
📞 Step 1: Add them both to a fake group chat called “SKIBIDI GRINDSET HQ”
💣 Step 2: Send an AI meme of them as Sigma Warriors fighting side-by-side.
🎤 Step 3: Play "See You Again" but distorted and 800% reverb.

🚶‍♂️ Then, Lakshya goes sigma mode in person.
🔥 Pulls up to Agastya like:
"Bro… forgive and forget. Remember the LAN party in 8th grade? She brought you Pepsi when your crush ghosted you."

💥 Agastya’s glasses fog up from sheer emotion.
He drops his protein shake.
💬 "Damn… you are right. Maybe I folded too hard."

💃 Then Lakshya hits up Arya:
"Listen. He’s still your Day 1. He was there when you failed your math test and blamed it on the moon phase."

😢 Arya gasps.
👀 Her eyes tear up… and she whispers:
*"Tell him… tell him I miss our Minecraft SMP…" 😭

🚀 LAKSHYA SPEEDRUNS TO AGASTYA — parkour style.
🥺 They meet at the school rooftop, where it all began.
💖 Epic music swells.

🎬 Agastya and Arya fist bump…
Then bro hug.
Then start quoting Vine references from 2016.
All while a giant Skibidi Toilet explodes in the background.

🎇 FINAL TEXT ON SCREEN:
"REAL FRIENDSHIP NEVER FOLDS. LAKSHYA = GOAT. 🐐"
